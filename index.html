                        Some things about me: I grew up in Orlando, Florida, but keep getting farther and farther out west. Colorado is by far the best place I've lived; I moved here in 2017. The past nine years I've been in the veterinary industry, however it was past time for a change. I miss the creativity where design meets functionality. Art is a passion of mine, everything from painting to embroidery to scultpture. I also enjoy cuddling with my cats Salem and Ollie, attempting not to kill my house plants, reading whenever I can find the time, playing Animal Crossing, and going to concerts or new restaurants.

                    <p>
                        When it comes to art I'm a bit of a Jack of all trades, master of none. I think it's because I genuinely enjoy creating, and am interested in so many medias. Since I was little I was always sketching, making forms out of clay, doing anything I could get my hands on. I spent hours going through Photoshop tutorials. In college I took a film photography course, losing myself in the magic of the darkroom, watching images process before my eyes. I even turned my focus onto building - designing garden beds, bedframes, and a two-person desk. I love any project that allows me to flex my creative side.

                    <p>
                        I love going on adventures! Exploring a new town, seeing a band I like, trying new delicious food, all great. However, I also love being at home - all my stuff is there! There's nothing better than a quiet weekend, curled up in the quilt my mom made, cats snoozing nearby, coffee and muffins on the table, working on my Animal Crossing island. Or perhaps bringing my picnic blanket to the park with a good book and a thermos of -ahem- grape juice to bask in the dappled shade for a few hours. The world moves so fast, it's such a relief to slow down and be cozy for a while.

                    <p>
                    As Sally Owens said, "I'm a witch!" Although not in the way the Owens sisters were, witchcraft to me is being in tune with nature and honoring the cycles of life. I admire the shifting of the seasons - the promise and new growth of spring, the vitality of summer, the coziness of fall, and the introspection of winter. Perhaps this is why I strive to keep bits of nature in my home, despite my lack of a green thumb. When my plants sprout a new leaf it brings me joy and pride; when they turn yellow I pay attention, try to figure out what it's telling me. Sometimes though, it's just my cats nibbling on the leaves.
